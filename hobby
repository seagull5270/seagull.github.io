	<i>An An Ode to Pond Hockey</i>

<p>Pond hockey is one of (my) life's greatest pleasures. It was a privilege to grow up next door to a lovely family whose property had a small pond in the back. During the winter, if we were lucky, the temperature would drop low enough for long enough so that the water would freeze, the skates would be tied and the play would commence.</p>

<p>I remember, on one fateful afternoon, my family and I were playing for hours on that ice. We would skate up and down the ice, tearing it up so that is became bumpy with snow and ice. Every half hour we would all break, take a snow shovel in hand, line up and plow the ice. Back and forth, back and forth until the ice was clear of snow and we could play again. Walking back down our neighbors long driveway after one such afternoon, I found myself turning to my father and asking, "Can I play hockey?"He looked at me confused, "We just played for hours, I think we're done for the day."I laughed and said, "I want to play for real, outside of pond hockey". He smiled in return and thus began my even great love of hockey.


<p>	When you find something like pond hockey, it has this magical element to it, where time speeds up as you frolic in the joy of the moment. suddenly hours have passed. I have found, especially as I have grown up, that those precious moments, where you are able to immerse yourself in the present moment, is very difficult to come by. If you find yourself a pond-hockey-type hobby, I recommmend finding every opportunity to lean in and PLAY!	</p><br>
